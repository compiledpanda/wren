# Why Wren

## Problem
Want a solution that 
- Offline forever
- Optionally sync
- User owned data, not service owned data (full encryption)
- Strong data & sharing controls
- Collaboration
    - Share data but I still can trump if I want
    - Certain data is mine alone, and no one elses
    - Share arbitrary sections with arbitrary people

Personal data that happens to be shared, vs shared data that happens to contain personal information

Local data that happens to be sync'd remotely, vs remote data that happens to be accessible while offline
